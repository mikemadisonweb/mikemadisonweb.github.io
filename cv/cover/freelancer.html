			<h4>Dear HR Manager,</h4>

			<h4>Considering the number of applications you probably receive, allow me to add a few reasons why I would
				be an asset to the company.</h4>
			<h4>I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and
				knowledge set. Having worked in the industry for nearly eight years, I’m still curious, enthusiastic,
				and open-minded, maybe even more then when I have just started. Every day is a school day.</h4>

			<h4>Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills. I have 8 years of software engineering
				experience with 4 years of supporting high-traffic applications. My arsenal of languages includes PHP,
				Golang, Javascript, and Python, with extensive experience of using various frameworks and libraries. I
				would be happy to tell you about the systems we have designed and implemented during these years.</h4>

			<h4>I am really glad that I have found this advertisement from Freelancer. I remember how I have used freelancer.com
				6 years ago, when I tried to become a freelancer. In the end, I realized that it does not fit me compared
				to the traditional full-time job. However, I remember that I was delighted by freelancer.com. It had
				such an easy and intuitive UI. I think that working on Freelancer is a nice opportunity for me to make an impact on people's lives. The tasks that freelancers are serving important real-life purposes.</h4>

			<h4>At my recent position with Docler Holding, I successfully participated in software deployments related
				to the new business features. Besides that, I have significantly contributed to the implementation of
				multiple internal tools that were intended to automate routine development actions and improve the error
				tracking process. I also took part in the on-call rotation, ensuring the site reliability at all
				times.</h4>

			<h4>Please note that as I’m in Luxembourg and I don’t have a work permit in
				Australia at the moment, I would require visa sponsorship for the role. I have already discussed the
				relocation with my family, and I can say with confidence that both my wife and I are absolutely
				positive about it.
			</h4>
			<h4>I have a notice period of one month at my current place of work, but as far as I know it is possible to
				negotiate.</h4>

			<h4>Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my background
				in greater detail and look forward to hearing from you.</h4>

			<h4>Sincerely, <br>
				Mikhail Bakulin</h4>
