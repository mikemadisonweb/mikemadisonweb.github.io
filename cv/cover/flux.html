			<h4>Dear HR Manager,</h4>

			<h4>I’m writing to express my interest in the position of
				<a href="https://fluxfederation.com/careers/opportunities/single-job/?496769">Senior Developer</a>,
				which you have advertised on your website. Considering the number of applications you
				probably receive, allow me to add a few reasons why I would be an asset to the company.</h4>
			<h4>I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and
				knowledge set. Having worked in the industry for nearly eight years, I’m still curious, enthusiastic,
				and
				open-minded, maybe even more then when I have just started. Every day is a school day.</h4>

			<h4>Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills:</h4>
			<ul class="fill-circle">
				<li>"As a senior developer you’ll have plenty of experience working across a number of languages and
					frameworks."<h4> - I have 8 years of software engineering experience with 4 years of supporting
						high-traffic applications. My arsenal of languages includes PHP, Golang, Javascript, and Python,
						with extensive experience of using various frameworks and libraries.</h4></li>
				<li>"It means you’re able to quickly pick up whatever technology is required to get the job done."<h4> -
					I am always eager to learn something new.</h4></li>
				<li>"You’ll be comfortable working across the stack whether that’s building business logic in a backend
					service, wiring up a front-end UI, or diving deep into operational tools and data to debug issues or
					optimise performance in one of our deployed environments."<h4> - During the last 3-4
						years, I have done mostly Backend, but I tried not to fall behind in Javascript(NodeJS). I know
						that Frontend world evolving rapidly, but I know the basics, and regarding the new fancy
						stuff, I am a fast learner.</h4></li>
				<li>"Ideally you’ll have the know-how and battle scars that come from continually improving a product
					that is required to be available 24/7."<h4> - Building auto-scaling and auto-healing distributed
						environments using tools like Docker and Kubernetes excite me a lot.</h4></li>
			</ul>

			<h4>At my recent position with Docler Holding, I successfully participated in software deployments
				related to the new business features. Besides that, I have significantly contributed to the
				implementation of multiple internal tools that were intended to automate routine development actions
				and improve the error tracking process. I also took part in the on-call rotation, ensuring the site
				reliability at all times.</h4>

			<h4>The possibility of contributing to the platform that is intended for innovative energy retailers sounds
				intriguing to me. I would love to help you achieve the desired goals, share in the wins, and contribute
				to the successes of the company.</h4>

			<h4>Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my background
				in greater detail and look forward to hearing from you.</h4>

			<h4>Sincerely, <br>
				Mikhail Bakulin</h4>
