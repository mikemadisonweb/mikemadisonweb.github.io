			<h4>Dear HR Manager,</h4>

			<h4>I’m writing to express my interest in the position of <a
					href="https://www.canva.com/careers/jobs/senior-web-engineer-backend-node-js-typescript-php/">Senior
				Web Engineer</a>, which you have advertised on your website. Considering the number of applications you
				probably receive, allow me to add a few reasons why I would be an asset to the company.</h4>

			<h4>I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and
				knowledge set. Having worked in the industry for nearly eight years, I’m still curious, enthusiastic,
				and open-minded, maybe even more then when I have just started. Every day is a school day.</h4>

			<h4>Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills:</h4>
			<ul class="fill-circle">
				<li>"Experience building complex and high-traffic based web portals, applications, and products"<h4> -
					Previously I have an extensive experience of creating high-traffic websites as well as webservices
					used by the mobile applications.</h4></li>
				<li>"Backend development experience with Node.js, Typescript, PHP, or Java"<h4> - During the last 3-4
					years, I have done mostly Backend, but I tried not to fall behind in Javascript(NodeJS). My main
					languages at the moment are PHP and Golang, but I am always keen to learn something new.</h4>
				</li>
				<li>"Strong understanding of algorithm complexity, data structures, concurrency & systems performance"
					and "Be able to demonstrate an understanding of operating systems, networking, and related protocols
					(especially HTTP, DNS, TCP/IP, SSL, etc)"<h4> - Ready to prove my knowledge during the
						interview.</h4></li>
				<li>"Bachelor of Computer Science or a related discipline"<h4> - As I have studied physics, I am mostly
					a self-learner in Software Engineering, but I have 8 years of hands-on experience.</h4></li>
				<li>"Nice-to-haves: HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript development experience is highly regarded. Also,
					experience managing small projects and coordinating across multiple offices and geographies."<h4> -
						I know that Frontend world evolving rapidly, but I remember basics, and regarding the new fancy
						stuff, I am learning fast.</h4></li>
			</ul>

			<h4>At my recent position with Docler Holding, I successfully participated in software deployments related
				to the new business features. Besides that, I have significantly contributed to the implementation of
				multiple internal tools that were intended to automate routine development actions and improve the error
				tracking process. I also took part in the on-call rotation, ensuring the site reliability at all
				times.</h4>

			<h4>When I tried Canva first time, I was impressed by how easy it is. Everything is in the place you think
				it's going to be. It is super intuitive. During my work, I have used Pixabay API multiple times to add
				some images to the dev environment. I did not know that it is a child company of Canva before. I would
				love to be a part of the fantastic work culture, share in the wins, and contribute to the successes of
				your company.</h4>

			<h4>Please note that as I’m in Luxembourg and I don’t have a work permit in Australia at the moment, I would
				require visa sponsorship for the role. I have already discussed the relocation with my family, and I can
				say with confidence that both my wife and I are absolutely positive about it.</h4>

			<h4>I’ve attached a copy of my CV that details my projects and experience in software development. I can be
				reached anytime via my cell phone +352 661-864-167 or via email at mikemadweb@gmail.com.</h4>

			<h4>Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my background in
				greater detail and look forward to hearing from you.</h4>

			<h4>Sincerely, <br>
				Mikhail Bakulin</h4>
