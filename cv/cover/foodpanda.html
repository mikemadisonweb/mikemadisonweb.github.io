			<h4>Dear HR Manager,</h4>

			<h4>I’m writing to express my interest in the position of Backend Software Engineer, which you have advertised on Stackoverflow's jobs section.
				Considering the number of applications you probably receive, allow me to present a few reasons why I
				would be an asset to the company.</h4>
			<h4>I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and
				knowledge set. Having worked in the industry for nearly eight years, I’m still curious enthusiastic, and
				open-minded, maybe even more then when I have just started. Every day is a school day.</h4>

			<h4>Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills:</h4>
			<ul class="fill-circle">
				<li>"Overall 6 years of experience with at least 4 years in Go & PHP is a MUST."<h4> - I have 8 years of
					experience with PHP and 3 years of Golang experience.</h4></li>
				<li>"Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or an equivalent education or practical experience."<h4> - As
					I
					have studied physics, I am mostly a self-learner in Software Engineering.</h4>
				</li>
				<li>"Very good communication skills in English, both written and spoken."<h4> - My recent company is multicultural and the official language in the office is English.</h4></li>
				<li>"Knowledge and understanding but not a must have Symphony, Blackfire, Java, Node.js, Travis,
					Blazemeter and apiary."<h4> - I was using Symfony for 3 years, including profiling with Blackfire. I
						have hands-on experience with Node.js. I don’t know Java, unfortunately. For the rest of the
						list, I have not touched these, but I used the alternative software.</h4></li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h4>At my recent position with Docler Holding, I successfully participated in software deployments related
				to the new business features. Besides that, I have significantly contributed to the implementation of
				multiple internal tools that were intended to automate routine development actions and improve the error
				tracking process. I also took part in the on-call rotation, ensuring the site reliability at all
				times.</h4>

			<h4>I have some colleagues who used to work in the Delivery Hero, which is a parent company of foodpanda as
				far as I know. I was impressed with the things I heard from them about the company. I would love to be a
				part of the fantastic work culture, share in the wins, and contribute to successes.</h4>

			<h4>Please note that as I’m in Luxembourg and I don’t have a work permit in Singapore at the moment, I would
				require visa sponsorship for the role. I have already discussed the relocation with my family, and I can
				say with confidence that both my wife and I are absolutely positive about it.</h4>

			<h4>I’ve attached a copy of my CV that details my projects and experience in software development. I can be
				reached anytime via my cell phone +352 661-864-167 or via email at mikemadweb@gmail.com.</h4>

			<h4>Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my background in
				greater detail and look forward to hearing from you.</h4>

			<h4>Sincerely,<br>
				Mikhail Bakulin</h4>
