			<h4>Dear HR Manager,</h4>

			<h4>I’m writing to express my interest in the position of <a
					href="https://hipagesgroup.com.au/careers/1087595/?gh_jid=1087595">Senior Fullstack Software
				Engineer</a>, which you have advertised on your website. Considering the number of applications you
				probably receive, allow me to add a few reasons why I would be an asset to the company.
			</h4>
			<h4>I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and
				knowledge set. Having worked in the industry for nearly eight years, I’m still curious, enthusiastic,
				and
				open-minded, maybe even more then when I have just started. Every day is a school day.</h4>

			<h4>Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills. I have 8 years of software engineering
				experience with 4 years of supporting high-traffic applications. My arsenal of languages includes PHP,
				Golang, Javascript, and Python, with extensive experience of using various frameworks and libraries. I
				would be happy to tell you about the systems we have designed and implemented during these years. The
				most important that you need to know about me is that I value my work. I am absolutely sure that the
				quality matters whatever task you have. Even if you are forced to deliver the feature fast, you need to
				find a way to do it properly. I like to think about writing software as building a house, without
				architecture, without thinking before you do something, without understanding the responsibility bad
				things would start to happen pretty quickly.</h4>

			<h4>At my recent position with Docler Holding, I successfully participated in software deployments
				related to the new business features. Besides that, I have significantly contributed to the
				implementation of multiple internal tools that were intended to automate routine development actions
				and improve the error tracking process. I also took part in the on-call rotation, ensuring the site
				reliability at all times. I have a notice period of one month at my current place of work, but as far as
				I know it is possible to negotiate.</h4>

			<h4>I know hipages because I have applied for the position of Software Engineer in 2017. I have drastically improved my skills and grew professionally since then. I have found a lot of information about hipages on the internet. I have checked out your Instagram, some of the corporate videos you have out there, and checked the reviews on glassdoor.com. Basically, that is what I am looking for, a reliable well-established company with a technically advanced stack and a good working culture. That is why I decided to apply again.</h4>

			<h4>Please note that as I’m in Luxembourg and I don’t have a work permit in
				Australia at the moment, I would require visa sponsorship for the role. I have already discussed the
					relocation with my family, and I can say with confidence that both my wife and I are absolutely
					positive about it.
			</h4>

			<h4>Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my background
				in greater detail and look forward to hearing from you.</h4>

			<h4>Sincerely, <br>
				Mikhail Bakulin</h4>
