			<h4>Dear HR Manager,</h4>

			<h4>I’m writing to express my interest in the position of <a
					href="https://autodesk.taleo.net/careersection/adsk_gen/jobdetail.ftl?job=19WD34602&tz=GMT%2B01%3A00&tzname=Europe%2FLuxembourg">Senior
				Software Engineer</a>, which you have advertised on your website. Considering the number of applications
				you probably receive, allow me to add a few reasons why I would be an asset to the company.</h4>
			<h4>I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and
				knowledge set. Having worked in the industry for nearly eight years, I’m still curious, enthusiastic,
				and open-minded, maybe even more then when I have just started. Every day is a school day.</h4>

			<h4>After my decision to change the job and relocate, I have checked a lot of different job postings, but
				the possibility of working at Autodesk intrigued me much more than the others. The reputation of the
				company speaks for itself, and its flagship product AutoCAD has become the de facto standard for
				computer-aided design applications. I am delighted that nowadays, the strategy of the company includes
				cloud-based solutions. It would be an honor for me to work at Autodesk, and I think I would be a good
				fit for the role. My arsenal of languages includes PHP, Golang, Javascript, and Python, with extensive
				experience of using various frameworks and libraries.</h4>

			<h4>The most important that you need to know about me is that I value my work. I am absolutely sure that the
				quality matters whatever task you have. Even if you are forced to deliver the feature fast, you need to
				find a way to do it properly. If I comply with the formal requirements for the role, please don't
				hesitate to send me a test challenge if you have one. I am ready to prove that I am good enough for the
				position</h4>

			<h4>At my recent position with Docler Holding, I successfully participated in software deployments
				related to the new business features. Besides that, I have significantly contributed to the
				implementation of multiple internal tools that were intended to automate routine development actions
				and improve the error tracking process. I also take part in the on-call rotation, ensuring the site
				reliability at all times.</h4>

			<h4>Please note that as I’m in Luxembourg and I don’t have a work permit in
				Singapore at the moment, I would require visa sponsorship for the role. I have already discussed the
				relocation with my family, and I can say with confidence that both my wife and I are absolutely
				positive about it.</h4>
			<h4>I have a notice period of one month at my current place of work, but as far as I know it is possible to
				negotiate.</h4>
			<h4>Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my background
				in greater detail and look forward to hearing from you.</h4>

			<h4>Sincerely, <br>
				Mikhail Bakulin</h4>
