			<h4>Dear HR Manager,</h4>

			<h4>I’m writing to express my interest in the position of
				<a href="https://apply.workable.com/seequent/j/5207EECAE3/">Senior Software Engineer</a>, which you have
				advertised on your website. Considering the number of applications you
				probably receive, allow me to add a few reasons why I would be an asset to the company.
			</h4>
			<h4>I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and
				knowledge set. Having worked in the industry for nearly eight years, I’m still curious, enthusiastic,
				and
				open-minded, maybe even more then when I have just started. Every day is a school day.</h4>

			<h4>Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills:</h4>
			<ul class="fill-circle">
				<li>"An interest in science (mathematical or science background)"<h4> - I have graduated as a physicist (chemical physics),
					did a postgraduate and then made a career change to a software engineer, so I have a science background.</h4></li>
				<li>"Brilliance, drive and motivation to work in a highly technical environment"<h4> - My profession is my main hobby, that is the best motivator.</h4></li>
				<li>"A high level of experience in coding practices and designs"<h4> - I am ready to prove my knowledge during the
					interview.</h4></li>
				<li>"Adaptability – we develop cloud, enterprise and Windows desktop applications using open-source
					tools; can you keep up?"<h4> - I don't have any experience in development for Windows, but I am a fast learner.</h4></li>
				<li>"Excellent collaboration skills"<h4> - I love being a part of the team. Sometimes it is challenging because everybody has his own opinion, but in the end together everyone achieves more.</h4></li>
			</ul>

			<h4>At my recent position with Docler Holding, I successfully participated in software deployments
				related to the new business features. Besides that, I have significantly contributed to the
				implementation of multiple internal tools that were intended to automate routine development actions
				and improve the error tracking process. I also took part in the on-call rotation, ensuring the site
				reliability at all times.</h4>
			<h4>From the description I felt that this role involves software engineering with a need to understand how
				things works from scientific point of view. That sounds intriguing. I think that the possibility of
				contributing to the geoscience software development is good way for me to make an impact, as such a
				software is used for the important purposes.</h4>
			<h4>Please note that as I’m in Luxembourg and I don’t have a work permit in
				New Zealand at the moment, I would require visa sponsorship for the role. I have already discussed the
				relocation with my family, and I can say with confidence that both my wife and I are absolutely
				positive about it.
			</h4>

			<h4>I’ve attached a copy of my CV that details my projects and experience in software development. I can
				be reached anytime via my cell phone +352 661-864-167 or via email at mikemadweb@gmail.com.</h4>

			<h4>Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my background
				in greater detail and look forward to hearing from you.</h4>

			<h4>Sincerely, <br>
				Mikhail Bakulin</h4>
