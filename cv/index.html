					<h4>Programming was always a field of interest for me. Even though I studied physics, we had an
						intense programming course in C++ and Delphi. However, the tasks we used to have back then was
						far from the real-life tasks.</h4>
					<h4>My professional career as a software engineer started in 2012, and the first language I have
						learned was PHP, as I found it a good fit for a start. Of course, it was a simple procedural
						code, and the tasks were relatively simple as well: database manipulation, form handling, etc.
						During the 8 last years, PHP became much more mature as a language. Meanwhile, I have also
						drastically improved my understanding of object-oriented programming, software architecture, and
						PHP internals.</h4>
					<h4>Since then my knowledge increased in the wide variety of general concepts, e.g.,
						data structures, algorithms, design patterns, defensive coding, and test automation. That's why
						learning
						next
						programming language took much less time. Development in Golang was a requirement for one of my
						former
						places of work. I have learned a lot about system programming, concurrency, profiling, and
						messaging. It was an excellent experience and I took a lot from that. There are some appropriate
						use-cases for the Golang services in my current daily work as well, so I still use it
						regularly.</h4>
					<h4>Python was my another language of choice, I love the clarity and expressiveness of the language,
						but unfortunately, I never had a chance to use it professionally. I used it in some of my pet
						projects or when I code just for fun.</h4>
					<h4>At the moment, I feel that I have more interest in the part of the development, which usually
						referred as SRE: containerization, container orchestration, system reliability,
						fault-tolerant architecture decisions, auto-scaling techniques, CI/CD pipelines, developer tools
						and so on.</h4>
					<h4>As a backend software engineer, I found that the most challenging decisions are related to
						application architecture. When the systems being built increase in size and load becomes
						more substantial, stricter requirements appear to have a resilient, robust, and scalable
						architecture for an app to be successful on the market. That process produces so many
						interesting puzzles
						to solve. It is so exciting to be a software engineer at the present moment, and I'm so happy
						that my hobby became my profession.</h4>

					<h4>Curiosity is my greatest strength, I am fond of making the unknown known, and I'm always excited
						to learn a new technology or programming language if needed.</h4>
					<h4>As you probably already noticed, I prefer to be concise and informative in the way I present
						information. To tell the full story and not to waste anyone's time is a fragile balance that is
						challenging to find. It would be presumptuous to say that I possess that exact balance, but even
						an aspiration to it is a benefit.</h4>
					<h4>I know the importance of the question "why?", I can explain my decisions clearly, and I respect
						the opinion of others. As the issues with multiple "right" solutions are not that rare, picking
						the way to go is not an easy task. That's why communication within the team is super important,
						and I am a team player.</h4>
					<h4>Sharing knowledge is fun and rewarding as it opens the possibility of deepening your knowledge
						and learn something from others in return.</h4>
					<h4>Last but not least, there is another form of communication, or it should be treated as such, in
						my opinion. The code that I am writing would be read by the software engineers that I may not
						even meet personally. The code itself needs to provide insights on the underlying logic. That is
						why I treat the code clarity and readability as an essential quality.</h4>

					<h3><strong>PHP developer</strong></h3>
					<h4><a href="https://www.doclerholding.com">Docler Holding</a></h4>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h4>It was an invaluable experience to work at the company hosting the largest live cam website
							in the world (Livejasmin, <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/livejasmin.com">Alexa Top
								28 rank</a>).
							The website has 35-40 million user visits per day and more
							than 2000 live streams at any given moment. Such impressive numbers created a lot of
							fascinating development challenges.</h4>
						<h4>I was lucky to get into the team responsible for the user side. It was interesting to
							develop new features and see the impact of them on the critical business metrics that we
							had. Most of the development was in PHP, but apart from that, I was in charge of creating
							the developer
							tools in Golang, which was mostly my initiative. Besides some minor ones there were an API
							client generator
							tool based on the specification and multiple system components needed for the error tracking
							integration. I have received a lot of positive feedback after the
							implementation from the developer colleagues.</h4>
						<h4>I was a part of the one from more than 20 autonomous, independent, and flat organized
							development teams. The most important thing that I took from that is the importance of the
							people interaction, especially in the form of verbal communication during the
							development of such a huge product. That was the first company I've seen that has fully
							incorporated Agile methodologies and precisely followed the Scrum best practices.</h4>

					<p class="period">June 2017 - July 2018</p>
					<h3><strong>Senior backend developer (Golang)</strong></h3>
					<h4><a href="https://www.admitad.com">Admitad GmbH</a></h4>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h4>For a year, I was working in the Moscow office of Admitad GmbH, which is an affiliate
							network with a global scale. I took part in the development of a couple of projects there,
							which were isolated from the main product. Development there had a startup spirit. We were
							completely free in the technical choices and technologies that we have used.</h4>
						<h4>They chose Golang in favor of PHP for example because of the requirement to reduce the
							latency as much as possible. I took this excellent opportunity
							to learn the language and to understand its specifics. Worth to mention that it took just a
							couple of weeks or me to write the first meaningful service on Golang and a couple of months
							to have full confidence in my actions because the background that I had helped me to master
							it quickly.</h4>
						<h4>The most exciting project I had in Admitad was to build a real-time bidding platform.
							Real-time bidding means that an auction for the user view is held between the advertisers
							when the user visits the page. Advertisers choose the price based on the data that is
							collected about the user. Most certainly, the user would not wait for the banner to appear,
							so the auction is supposed to take no more than 200ms. Probably that was the most fun and
							challenging project I have created from scratch. That was the time I learned a lot about
							distributed system communication strategies, failure handling scenarios, and event-driven
							architecture. What deserves a special mention is awesome Golang ecosystem tools that were
							quite handy to ensure the best performance (profiling and tracing).</h4>
						<h4>That was the place where I got familiar with Kubernetes as we were in charge of the
							infrastructure as well, I still have a great interest in that field. Containerisation helped
							us to build predictable, almost identical development environments, it solved a bunch of
							problems for us, but it had its price as the complexity increased drastically.</h4>

					<h3><strong>Senior backend developer</strong></h3>
					<h4><a href="https://tass.com">TASS</a></h4>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h4>TASS is a major news agency in Russia founded back in 1904. To keep up with the times, they
							did a lot to embrace a new digital era. That includes not only the website and web app
							development but also the creation of the set of internal services covering most of the
							business processes.</h4>
						<h4>I was implementing one such internal system that was used for the sales and distribution of
							the news. It has a PHP and NodeJS parts with a single page application written using
							ReactJS. My responsibility was mostly the backend parts, which provided an API to the
							frontend and a WebSocket connection for real-time updates. That was the place I got familiar
							with the service-oriented and event-driven architecture: an article was going through the
							multiple stages of categorization and keyword detection using the neural network before
							being added to the feed and the search index. As far as I heard, agency partners were
							delighted with the results we have provided them.</h4>

					<h3><strong>Full-stack developer</strong></h3>
					<h4><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/siit-informika">Informika</a></h4>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h4>The time I worked in Informika gave me a lot in terms of professional growth. It is a
							government company curated by the Ministry of Education. Multiple projects were designed and
							implemented in the scope of the government program, to name a few: Russian electronic
							school(kind of Coursera for school), photo stock for Russian Geographical Society, etc.</h4>
						<h4>I got familiar with scrum methodologies there. Back in the days, it has opened my eyes on
							the role of the processes in the project's success.</h4>
						<h4>Most of the applications we made there were monoliths with external dependencies of
							PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, etc. It was a simpler time, there were no requirements
							for a huge load, scale, or something, but I remember how much faster we could deliver a
							feature or investigate a bug.</h4>
						<h4>Back then, I realized how much fun it could be to arrange team meetups to share the
							knowledge on the various tech topics.</h4>

					</h4>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h4>After the career change, I needed to start from scratch, to learn basic programming
							concepts, and to learn a language that fits well to the web application development. I
							studied programming on my own by reading books, articles, watching videos, but it only
							started to make sense after I tried the concepts I read about in real-life tasks. Luckily
							back then, I got an opportunity to get the position of a full-stack software engineer in
							ISAN. It is a research institute, but they have their own IT department. I gained
							the needed skills, and soon enough after I have joined, I started to do simple tasks like
							fixing their website, writing their intranet tools, etc.</h4>
